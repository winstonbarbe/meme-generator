# Meme Generator

## Adding React Route

- 04/24/21 - _wb_ - I am implmenting the react router, so that we can have different views for things like login/signup, memes index, memes new, etc.
- 04/25/21 - _wb_ - I am moving the routing and nav into the header compononent
- 04/25/21 - _wb_ - w/r/t the previous point - I am not this right now. While I think it makes sense there seem to be subtlties that I am not totally understanding and that I think are not the most pressing issue currently

**Note**: _Need to find out more about styling and proper functionality for Router_
